This is a stupid very small script that makes query to google contact address
book and print result in a mutt understandable format. To make query faster
google contacts are fetched locally.

This uses the googlecl program (http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/)

Modify BOOKCACHE variable to point to a proper address book cache destination
and then copy gcontacts.sh anywhere you want.

== Muttrc ==

You can add this to your muttrc :

#google address book query
set query_command = "PATH-TO-GCONTACTS.SH list '%s'"
bind editor \t complete-query
macro index,pager gr "<shell-escape>PATH-TO-GCONTACTS.SH fetch<enter>" "Gcontacts fetch address book"
